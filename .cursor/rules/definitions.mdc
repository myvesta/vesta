- This project is Hosting Panel software, its purpose is to configure nginx, Apache2, ProFTPD, Bind9, MariaDB, PHP-FPM, Exim4, Dovecot, SpamAssassin, ClamAV, Fail2Ban, and Cron services, to make a Linux server work as a web hosting and mail server.
- This project is called "myVesta" and is a fork of the VestaCP project.
- The GitHub URL for this open-source project is https://github.com/myvesta/vesta/
- The "example-of-linux-root-folder" folder of this project represents a / folder on the Linux server. 
- For example, the 'example-of-linux-root-folder\etc' folder in this project is the '/etc' folder on the Linux server, the 'example-of-linux-root-folder\home' folder in this project is the '/home' folder on the Linux server, etc.
- The git repository is in the root folder of this project.
- The main project is in the root folder of this project, which is the '/usr/local/vesta' folder on the Linux server.
- However, some subfolders that are 'server config files' can not be in the root folder of this project (can not be in the root of this git repository), and because of that they are stored in the 'example-of-linux-root-folder\usr\local\vesta' subfolders in this project which represents the subfolders of '/usr/local/vesta' folder on the Linux server. For example, the folder 'example-of-linux-root-folder\usr\local\vesta\data' means the '/usr/local/vesta/data' folder on the Linux server.
- So, map the root of this project as the '/usr/local/vesta' folder on the Linux server, plus, map the subfolders of 'example-of-linux-root-folder\usr\local\vesta' to the same '/usr/local/vesta' folder on the Linux server.
- Main binary files are in the folder 'bin', which is the '/usr/local/vesta/bin' folder on the Linux server.
- Includes (additional functions) are in the folder 'func', which is the '/usr/local/vesta/func' folder on the Linux server.
- Binary files and functions are written in Bash scripting language.
- Backend PHP scripts are in the folder 'web', which is the '/usr/local/vesta/web' folder on the Linux server.
- Apache templates are in the folder 'example-of-linux-root-folder\usr\local\vesta\data\templates\web\apache2', which is the '/usr/local/vesta/data/templates/web/apache2' folder on the Linux server.
- Nginx templates are in the folder 'example-of-linux-root-folder\usr\local\vesta\data\templates\web\nginx', which is the '/usr/local/vesta/data/templates/web/nginx' folder on the Linux server.
- Apache and Nginx templates are compiled to the 'example-of-linux-root-folder\home\admin\conf\web' folder, which is the '/home/admin/conf/web' folder on the Linux server.
- URL path '/webmail/' (URL path to 'Roundcube Webmail' for hosted websites on the Linux server, for example: https://hostname.com/webmail/) is defined in the 'example-of-linux-root-folder\etc\roundcube\apache.conf' file ('/etc/roundcube/apache.conf' file on the Linux server) and in the 'example-of-linux-root-folder\etc\nginx\conf.d\webmail.inc' file ('/etc/nginx/conf.d/webmail.inc' file on the Linux server) folders, but also in the 'example-of-linux-root-folder\usr\local\vesta\data\templates\web\nginx\force-https-webmail-phpmyadmin.stpl' file ('/usr/local/vesta/data/templates/web/nginx/force-https-webmail-phpmyadmin.stpl' on the Linux server), in the 'example-of-linux-root-folder\usr\local\vesta\data\templates\web\nginx\hosting-webmail-phpmyadmin.stpl' file ('/usr/local/vesta/data/templates/web/nginx/hosting-webmail-phpmyadmin.stpl' on the Linux server), and in the 'example-of-linux-root-folder\usr\local\vesta\data\templates\web\nginx\hosting-webmail-phpmyadmin.tpl' file ('/usr/local/vesta/data/templates/web/nginx/hosting-webmail-phpmyadmin.tpl' on the Linux server).
- URL path '/phpmyadmin/' (URL path to 'phpMyAdmin' for hosted websites on the Linux server, for example: https://hostname.com/phpmyadmin/) is defined in the 'example-of-linux-root-folder\etc\phpmyadmin\apache.conf' file ('/etc/phpmyadmin/apache.conf' file on the Linux server) and in the 'example-of-linux-root-folder\etc\nginx\phpmyadmin.inc' file ('/etc/nginx/conf.d/phpmyadmin.inc' file on the Linux server) folders, but also in the 'example-of-linux-root-folder\usr\local\vesta\data\templates\web\nginx\force-https-webmail-phpmyadmin.stpl' file ('/usr/local/vesta/data/templates/web/nginx/force-https-webmail-phpmyadmin.stpl' on the Linux server), in the 'example-of-linux-root-folder\usr\local\vesta\data\templates\web\nginx\hosting-webmail-phpmyadmin.stpl' file ('/usr/local/vesta/data/templates/web/nginx/hosting-webmail-phpmyadmin.stpl' on the Linux server), and in the 'example-of-linux-root-folder\usr\local\vesta\data\templates\web\nginx\hosting-webmail-phpmyadmin.tpl' file ('/usr/local/vesta/data/templates/web/nginx/hosting-webmail-phpmyadmin.tpl' on the Linux server).
- To conclude, this is how you should map folders if you want to understand their positions on the Linux server:
(in this project) example-of-linux-root-folder\ = / (on the Linux server)
(in this project) example-of-linux-root-folder\backup\ = /backup/ (on the Linux server)
(in this project) example-of-linux-root-folder\etc\ = /etc/ (on the Linux server)
(in this project) example-of-linux-root-folder\home\ = /home/ (on the Linux server)
(in this project) example-of-linux-root-folder\root\ = /root/ (on the Linux server)
(in this project) example-of-linux-root-folder\tmp\ = /tmp/ (on the Linux server)
(in this project) example-of-linux-root-folder\var\ = /var/ (on the Linux server)
(in this project) example-of-linux-root-folder\usr\ = /usr/ (on the Linux server)
(in this project) example-of-linux-root-folder\usr\local\vesta\data\ = /usr/local/vesta/data/ (on the Linux server)
(in this project) example-of-linux-root-folder\usr\local\vesta\conf\ = /usr/local/vesta/conf/ (on the Linux server)
(in this project) example-of-linux-root-folder\usr\local\vesta\ssl\ = /usr/local/vesta/ssl/ (on the Linux server)
(in this project) example-of-linux-root-folder\usr\local\vesta\log\ = /usr/local/vesta/log/ (on the Linux server)
(in this project) bin\ = /usr/local/vesta/bin/ (on the Linux server)
(in this project) func\ = /usr/local/vesta/func/ (on the Linux server)
(in this project) install\ = /usr/local/vesta/install/ (on the Linux server)
(in this project) src\ = /usr/local/vesta/src/ (on the Linux server)
(in this project) web\ = /usr/local/vesta/web/ (on the Linux server)
(in this project) upd\ = /usr/local/vesta/upd/ (on the Linux server)
(in this project) test\ = /usr/local/vesta/test/ (on the Linux server)
